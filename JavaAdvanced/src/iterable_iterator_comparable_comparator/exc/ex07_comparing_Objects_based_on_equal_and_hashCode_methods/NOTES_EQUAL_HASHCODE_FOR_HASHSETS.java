     * when trying to add `Person` objects to the `TreeSet`.
     *
     * To fix this, you need to ensure that your `Person` class implements the `Comparable`
     * interface and overrides the `compareTo()` method. Here's an example:

     * ```java
     * public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {

     *     private int age;
     *
     *     // constructor, getters, setters, equals(), and hashCode() methods

     *     @Override

     *         int nameComparison = this.name.compareTo(other.name);

     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, `Person` objects are first compared by `name`,
     * and if their names are the same, they are then compared by `age`.
     * This ensures that `Person` objects with the same name
     * but different ages are not considered equal by the `TreeSet`.
     *
     * Please ensure that your `Person` class is defined similarly to handle the `TreeSet` correctly.

    /**
     * what is the difference between  TreeSet and HashSet?
     *
     * `TreeSet` and `HashSet` are both implementations of the `Set` interface in Java,
     * but they have some key differences:
     *
     * 1. **Ordering**: `TreeSet` maintains elements in a sorted order (either natural order or custom order
     * defined by a `Comparator`), while `HashSet` does not guarantee any specific order of elements.
     *
     * 2. **Performance**: `HashSet` offers constant time performance for basic operations like `add`, `remove`,
     * and `contains`, assuming the hash function disperses elements properly among the buckets. On the other hand,
     * `TreeSet` guarantees log(n) time cost for the basic operations.
     *
     * 3. **Null Elements**: `HashSet` allows one null element, while `TreeSet` does not allow null elements.
     *
     * 4. **Internal Structure**: `TreeSet` is implemented as a Red-Black Tree, which is a type of self-balancing
     * binary search tree. `HashSet` is backed by a `HashMap` instance.
     *
     * Here's a simple comparison in code:
     *
     * ```java
     * import java.util.HashSet;
     * import java.util.TreeSet;
     *
     * public class Main {
     *     public static void main(String[] args) {
     *         HashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
     *         hashSet.add("Orange");
     *         hashSet.add("Apple");
     *         hashSet.add("Banana");
     *         System.out.println("HashSet: " + hashSet);
     *
     *         TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
     *         treeSet.add("Orange");
     *         treeSet.add("Apple");
     *         treeSet.add("Banana");
     *         System.out.println("TreeSet: " + treeSet);
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, the `HashSet` output could be in any order, while the `TreeSet`
     * output will always be in ascending order: `[Apple, Banana, Orange]`.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * does a Comparator work for hashset?
     *
     * No, a `Comparator` does not work directly with a `HashSet` in Java.
     * The `HashSet` class does not have a constructor that accepts a `Comparator`
     * because it does not guarantee any specific order of its elements.
     *
     * However, if you need a `Set` that maintains order and allows for custom sorting, you can use a `TreeSet`
     * with a `Comparator`, or you can use a `LinkedHashSet` which maintains the insertion order.
     *
     * If you need to sort a `HashSet`, you typically convert it to a `List` and then sort the `List`
     * using `Collections.sort()`, providing your `Comparator` if necessary. Here's an example:
     *
     * ```java
     * import java.util.*;
     *
     * public class Main {
     *     public static void main(String[] args) {
     *         HashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
     *         hashSet.add("Orange");
     *         hashSet.add("Apple");
     *         hashSet.add("Banana");
     *
     *         List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(hashSet);
     *         list.sort(Comparator.naturalOrder());
     *
     *         System.out.println(list); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, the `HashSet` is converted to an `ArrayList`, and then the `ArrayList`
     * is sorted in natural order using a `Comparator`.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * what is the equal and hashCode methods?
     *
     * The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are part of the `Object` class in Java
     * and are therefore available to all Java objects. They play an important role in
     * the functioning of Java collections, especially hashed collections like `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.
     *
     * **equals()**
     *
     * The `equals(Object obj)` method is used to determine if two objects are equal.
     * The default implementation in the `Object` class checks for reference equality,
     * meaning it returns `true` if two references point to the exact same object. However,
     * it's common to override this method in your own classes to provide a custom equality check.
     * For example, you might define two `Person` objects to be equal if they have the same name and age.
     *
     * Here's an example of an overridden `equals()` method:
     *
     * ```java
     * @Override
     * public boolean equals(Object obj) {
     *     if (this == obj) return true;
     *     if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
     *     Person person = (Person) obj;
     *     return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **hashCode()**
     *
     * The `hashCode()` method returns an integer hash code representing the object.
     * The general contract of `hashCode` is that if two objects are equal according to the `equals(Object)` method,
     * then calling the `hashCode` method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * This is important for the correct functioning of hashed collections.
     *
     * Here's an example of an overridden `hashCode()` method:
     *
     * ```java
     * @Override
     * public int hashCode() {
     *     return Objects.hash(name, age);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, the `hashCode()` method uses the `hash()` method from the `Objects` utility class
     * to generate a hash code based on the `name` and `age` fields.
     *
     * It's important to note that if you override `equals()`, you should also override `hashCode()`,
     * and vice versa, to ensure that your objects behave correctly in collections.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * what do you mean by this: the hashCode() method uses the hash() method from the Objects utility class
     * to generate a hash code based on the name and age fields.  Is not name and age two different objects
     *
     * Yes, `name` and `age` are indeed two different fields of an object. However,
     * when we talk about the `hashCode()` method, we are referring to a way to generate a unique identifier
     * for an object based on its state (i.e., the values of its fields).
     *
     * The `Objects.hash(Object... values)` method is a utility method provided by Java that generates
     * a hash code based on the values of multiple fields. It takes a variable number of arguments (or an array of objects),
     * and it returns a hash code value that is based on the values of these arguments.
     *
     * In the context of the `Person` class, the `hashCode()` method uses the `Objects.hash()` method
     * to generate a hash code that is based on the `name` and `age` fields. This means that two `Person` objects
     * with the same `name` and `age` will have the same hash code.
     *
     * Here's the code snippet for clarity:
     *
     * ```java
     * @Override
     * public int hashCode() {
     *     return Objects.hash(name, age);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this code, `Objects.hash(name, age)` generates a hash code value that is based on the values of `name` and `age`.
     * This hash code value is then returned by the `hashCode()` method.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * and if these two persons have a third field town and it is different for both, but we pass to the hashCode only
     * the name and the age, then will these two Persons have again the same hashcode?
     *
     * Yes, if the `hashCode()` method of the `Person` class only uses the `name` and `age` fields
     * to generate the hash code, then two `Person` objects with the same `name` and `age` but different `town`
     * values will indeed have the same hash code.
     *
     * This is because the `hashCode()` method does not consider the `town` field in its calculation.
     * The `hashCode()` method only knows about the fields that you explicitly use in its calculation.
     *
     * Here's an example:
     *
     * ```java
     * public class Person {
     *     private String name;
     *     private int age;
     *     private String town;
     *
     *     // constructor, getters and setters
     *
     *     @Override
     *     public boolean equals(Object o) {
     *         if (this == o) return true;
     *         if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
     *         Person person = (Person) o;
     *         return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name);
     *     }
     *
     *     @Override
     *     public int hashCode() {
     *         return Objects.hash(name, age);
     *     }
     * }
     *
     * Person person1 = new Person("John", 25, "New York");
     * Person person2 = new Person("John", 25, "Los Angeles");
     *
     * System.out.println(person1.hashCode()); // Output: 12345678 (example)
     * System.out.println(person2.hashCode()); // Output: 12345678 (example)
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, `person1` and `person2` have the same `name` and `age`, but different `town` values.
     * However, because the `hashCode()` method only uses `name` and `age` in its calculation, `person1` and `person2`
     * have the same hash code.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * what is the use of the hashCode method then?
     *
     * The `hashCode()` method in Java is used primarily in conjunction with hashed data structures, like `HashSet`, `
     * HashMap`, and `HashTable`. These data structures use the hash code of objects to determine where to store
     * the objects and how to retrieve them efficiently.
     *
     * Here's a brief explanation of how it works:
     *
     * 1. When an object is stored in a hashed data structure, the `hashCode()` method of the object is called,
     * and the returned hash code is used to determine the location (bucket) where the object will be stored.
     *
     * 2. When you try to retrieve or remove an object from the hashed data structure, the `hashCode()`
     * method is called again to find the bucket where the object should be. Then, within that bucket, the `equals()`
     * method is used to find the exact object.
     *
     * This mechanism allows hashed data structures to have constant-time performance for the basic operations
     * (`add`, `remove`, `contains`, and `size`), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly
     * among the buckets.
     *
     * It's important to note that if you override the `equals()` method in your class, you should also override
     * the `hashCode()` method, and vice versa. This is to ensure that equal objects (according to the `equals()` method)
     * also have equal hash codes. If this contract is violated, the hashed data structures may not work correctly.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * does treeset and hashset allow for duplicates
     *
     * No, both `TreeSet` and `HashSet` in Java do not allow duplicate elements. They are both implementations
     * of the `Set` interface, which is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.
     *
     * - `HashSet`: This class implements the `Set` interface, backed by a hash table (actually a `HashMap` instance).
     * It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that
     * the order will remain constant over time. It allows null elements.
     *
     * - `TreeSet`: This class implements the `Set` interface that uses a tree for storage. Objects
     * are stored in a sorted and ascending order. Access and retrieval times are quite fast, which makes
     * `TreeSet` an excellent choice when storing large amounts of sorted information that must be found quickly.
     * It does not allow null elements.
     *
     * Here's a simple example of how duplicates are not allowed:
     *
     * ```java
     * import java.util.HashSet;
     * import java.util.TreeSet;
     *
     * public class Main {
     *     public static void main(String[] args) {
     *         HashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
     *         hashSet.add("Hello");
     *         hashSet.add("Hello");
     *         System.out.println(hashSet.size()); // Output: 1
     *
     *         TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
     *         treeSet.add("Hello");
     *         treeSet.add("Hello");
     *         System.out.println(treeSet.size()); // Output: 1
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, we try to add the string "Hello" twice to both a `HashSet` and a `TreeSet`.
     * When we print the size of each set, the output is 1, not 2, indicating that the duplicate element
     * was not added to the set.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * Overriding the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in the `Person` class is indeed crucial
     * for the correct functioning of the `HashSet`, as these methods are used to determine equality
     * and hash value of the objects. However, for the `TreeSet`, it's not enough.
     *
     * The `TreeSet` class in Java uses a tree structure for storing its elements and it requires a way

     * you will get a `ClassCastException` when trying to add `Person` objects to the `TreeSet`.

     *         }
     *         return result;
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * In this example, `Person` objects are first compared by `name`, and if their names are the same,
